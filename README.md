Interested in ML, specifically in applications of ML to (financial) time series forecasting. 
Working on projects as follows:
  - NLP for sentiment detection from financial news,
  - SVM based classification for net market sentiment,
  - Random Forests, (stochastic) gradient descent for forecasting,
  - Applications of lower level languages to solving PDEs numerically:
       - Wave equation eigenfunctions,
       - 2D Heat Equation,
       - Inhomogenous Readction-Diffusion in 2D
